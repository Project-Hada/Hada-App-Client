# Hada - Korean Flashcard Learning App

## Introduction

Hada is a Korean flashcard learning app that leverages the power of spaced repetition to optimize the learning process. Spaced repetition is a learning technique where review intervals for each flashcard are systematically increased to embed knowledge more deeply. Unlike other platforms, Hada is designed to streamline your learning experience, making it simpler, more efficient, and tailored to your needs.

### The Problem with Other Apps
- **[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)**: Fun but lacks sufficient input, minimal vocabulary acquisition.
- **[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)**: Complex user flow, lacks spaced repetition, underutilizing flashcard potential.
- **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)**: Offers spaced repetition, suffers from an open-source, less intuitive UI, complex flashcard sharing.
- **[Drops](https://languagedrops.com/)**: Limits user control with preset study lists and a complicated user flow.

### Hada's Solution
Hada focuses on simplicity and efficiency. Our approach is to:
- Maximize exposure to new words and sets created by others.
- Enhance learning through listening with auto-play features.
- Implement an effective study algorithm for spaced repetition.
- Offer a seamless, stress-free flashcard study experience with minimal effort required from the user.
